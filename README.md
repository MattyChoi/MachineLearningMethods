# MachineLearningMethods

Just a repository of machine learning methods. Currently, I only have neural networks created from scratch but I will start working on parametric methods and nonparametric methods (super excited about coding random forests and gradient boosting) and unsupervised methods such as EM algorithms and k means clustering.
